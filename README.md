🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning:

A machine learning-driven healthcare analytics system aimed at enhancing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment by leveraging structured clinical, lifestyle, and genetic data. This project was developed as part of a research initiative at Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi.

📘 Abstract:

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of global mortality. This project presents a hybrid machine learning framework for early detection and risk stratification of CVDs. Supervised algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost were employed. The focus lies in optimizing model performance, handling class imbalance, and ensuring clinical interpretability through explainable AI techniques.
